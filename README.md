Description

This repository contains the source code for an Employee Email Notification Application, developed by Yusan Pamungkas Wijaya. The application is designed to streamline communication between companies and their employees by sending important notifications directly to employees' email addresses. It ensures that employees are well-informed about their employment milestones, helping them prepare necessary documents and avoid missing critical deadlines.

Features

Welcome Notification: Automatically sends a welcome email to new employees when they start working in the company.

Promotion Reminder: Sends an email notification 6 months before an employee's 4-year work anniversary, reminding them to prepare documents for promotion.

Salary Increase Reminder: Sends an email notification 6 months before an employee's 2-year work anniversary, reminding them to prepare documents for a salary increment.

User-Friendly Management: Provides an intuitive interface for managing employee information and scheduling notifications.

Purpose

The primary goal of this application is to act as a reminder system for employees in government organizations, where many workers often forget critical timelines for promotions and salary increases. By ensuring timely reminders, the application aims to prevent financial and career growth delays for employees.
